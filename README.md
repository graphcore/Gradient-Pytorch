# Training PyTorch Models on IPUs using Paperspace Gradient

Discover how to use PyTorch with IPUs. These examples use PopTorch, a set of extensions to PyTorch to enable PyTorch models to run on Graphcore IPUs. And by using Paperspace to access IPUs you can be up and running in minutes!

Run the notebooks in this repository on our ready-to-use IPU Machines in Paperspace Gradient:
